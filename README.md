# Download these first! Then go down to the tutorial!

THIS IS THE MAIN STEP, INSTALL YARN BY TYPING npm install --global yarn IN COMMAND PROMPT!!!!!!!


# Full Launcher tutorial!
Okay, now what you need to do here is go into the launcher folder (install the folder by clicking the code button and click download zip (or wtv it says) 
Now that you have it installed open it and were it says the name of the folder at the top (the really long bar) click it and delete all the text up there and type in the word cmd 
Once you have cmd typed in that bar press enter. It will open up a command prompt! Simply type the word code. MAKE SURE IT'S TYPED EXACTLY LIKE THIS: code.     WITH THE PERIOD! 
Now once in there you can head to the index's and change the names to wtv you want (the indexes are the one's that end with .html)! 
Then go into main.js and change that link to your dll's download link! (Make a github acc and upload it in. then were it says the dll click on it's name in the github repo and then it will say view raw. Right click it and copy the exact link. Then upload into the launcher)
Your so close! Now MAKE SURE YOU INSTALL YARN UP THERE!!! then you need to click the button in vs code that says terminal and simply make a new terminal! then type the words yarn start in the terminal and your good to go, (yarn start is to debug and test the launcher)
The final step is typing yarn build! And just like that your done!
